<p>
<b>Hi! I'm Eren.</b> I'm a 20 year old sophomore at NYU majoring in CS. I like singing, hiking, humbling business majors, and being mom's most handsome son.
</p>

<p>
<b>Right now, I'm developing STGCNNs to forecast flash floods across New York City.</b> Long-term, I want to get into AI4Science to solve physics problems.
</p>

<p>
I'm also minoring in Math and Quantum Technology because I love suffering. My grandma always says I'm good at <b>Python/PyTorch</b> too.
</p>

<p>
Take a look around. No flashy animations. Loads under 0.2s.
</p>

Contact me at <a href="mailto:em5227@nyu.edu">em5227@nyu.edu</a>. Here's my <a href="images/resume.pdf">resume</a> and <a href="https://github.com/erenmenges">GitHub</a>.

<h2>Current Work</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Flood Denoising and Forecasting with STGCNNs</b>
<ul>
<li>I'm developing a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCNN) to forecast flash floods across 229 physical sensor nodes in NYC. Flash floods still take lives in 2026 and I can't stand it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<b>Spectral Clustering with Linear Algebra</b>
<ul>
<li>Implementing Spectral Clustering algorithms from scratch to identify non-convex structures often misclassified by classical K-Means. Just a fun little project to practice LA.</li>
<li>I'm also building my custom linear algebra module to compute Graph Laplacians and perform eigendecomposition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Traditional clustering algorithms fail spectacularly with these shapes.</p>

<h2>Experience</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Machine Learning Research Intern, C2SMART Center for Urban Mobility, NYU</b> &mdash; Jun 2025 - Aug 2025
<ul>
<li>I trained and benchmarked 7 trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles on Argoverse2. Found that the EMP architecture keeps up with MTR accuracy at ~50% the compute and 6&times; faster training. Details in my <a href="images/resume.pdf">resume</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stuff I Like</h2>

<p>
Home-cooked dinners. Flight simulators. Video games. Legally drinking with friends. I know this is corny, but I love America. It's the best place I've ever been to outside my own. I also wanna be an EMT if I get the time.
