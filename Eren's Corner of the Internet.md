# Eren's Corner of the Internet

__Hi! I'm Eren.__ I'm a 20 year old sophomore at NYU majoring in CS. I like singing, hiking, humbling business majors, and being mom's most handsome son.

__Right now, I'm developing STGCNNs to forecast flash floods across New York City.__ Long-term, I want to get into AI4Science to solve physics problems.

I'm also minoring in Math and Quantum Technology because I love suffering. My grandma always says I'm good at __Python/PyTorch__ too.

Take a look around. No flashy animations. Loads under 0.2s.

Contact me at em5227@nyu.edu. Here's my [resume](images/resume.pdf).

## Current Work

 * __Flood Denoising and Forecasting with STGCNNs__ 
  * I'm developing a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCNN) to forecast flash floods across 229 physical sensor nodes in NYC. Flash floods still take lives in 2026 and I can't stand it.

* __Spectral Clustering with Linear Algebra__
 * Implementing Spectral Clustering algorithms from scratch to identify non-convex structures often misclassified by classical K-Means. Just a fun little project to practice LA.
 * I'm also building my custom linear algebra module to compute Graph Laplacians and perform eigendecomposition.

Traditional clustering algorithms fail spectacularly with these shapes.

## Experience

* __Machine Learning Research Intern, C2SMART Center for Urban Mobility, NYU__ Jun 2025 - Aug 2025
  * I trained and benchmarked 7 trajectory prediction models for autonomous vehicles on Argoverse2. Found that the EMP architecture keeps up with MTR accuracy at ~50% the compute and 6× faster training. Details in my resume.

## Stuff I like
Home-cooked dinners. Flight simulators. Video games. Legally drinking with friends. I know this is corny, but I love America. It's the best place I've ever been to outside my own. I also wanna be an EMT if I get the time.
